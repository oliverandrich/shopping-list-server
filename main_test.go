// Note: Testing the main() function directly is challenging because it starts a server
// In production scenarios, you would typically:
// 1. Extract the server setup logic into testable functions
// 2. Use integration tests with test servers
// 3. Mock external dependencies like databases and email services
// 
// For now, we focus on testing the individual components which provide good coverage
